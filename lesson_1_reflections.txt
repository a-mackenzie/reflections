How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    The bug must be due to something that has changed so seeing only lines that
    have changed really speeds this up

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can easily view the state of the file at any point, identifying historical
    bugs, things that worked/didn't work etc.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You can create versions at specific points chosen by you, rather than at random.
    So when you can made a specific update for example

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Allows you to save versions of a full app as one, with interdependant files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows the commit log for a file - i.e. what happened at that commit
    git diff shows changes between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can easily revert back to an old version if something breaks

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
