When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Useful when collaborating with other people, or when you need to access your work from different computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    There may be changes made by other people on GitHub that you do not want locally. They may also conflict with changes you have been making.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks clone a repository from one GitHub account to another. 
    Clones are used to copy a repository from GutHub to a local computer, or from one local directory to another. 
    Branches allow you to make changes to a repository without affecting the master, i.e. experimental changes etc. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    When you next pull from the remote you can use git diff to view all changes made since your last pull

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Using other file sharing sites such as google docs. This would be much harder to track changes, work on different tasks concurrently, merge changes together etc. etc. I don't see anything that would be easier...

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
